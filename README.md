### Hi everyone :wave:


My name is Bartek and I work as **Software and Test Engineer at** [**Nokia**](https://nokiakrakow.pl/) (mainly with 5G and mobile networks). I'm in my last year of studies towards a **bachelor's in Computer Science** at the [Cracow University of Technology](https://it.pk.edu.pl/). I&nbsp;mainly code in `Python 3` (FastAPI, Robot Framework &&nbsp;5G/networking) and work with `Linux`.
